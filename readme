# Steps 1

- Add environment variables

- a. Define the SonarCloud Token environment variable

    In GitLab, go to Settings > CI/CD > Variables to add the following variable and make sure it is available for your project:

        In the Key field, enter SONAR_TOKEN

	In the Value field, enter (see your page)

    Make sure that the Protect variable checkbox is unticked

    Make sure that the Mask variable checkbox is ticked

 Still in Settings > CI/CD > Variables add a new variable and make sure it is available for your project:

    In the Key field, enter SONAR_HOST_URL

    In the Value field, enter https://sonarcloud.io

    Make sure that the Protect variable checkbox is unticked
    No need to tick the Mask variable checkbox this time

- Create or update a .gitlab-ci.yml file

What option best describes your build?

    Maven Gradle C,C++ or ObjC  Other (for JS, TS, Go, Python, PHP, ...)


# Step 2
